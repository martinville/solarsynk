## How it works
SolarSynk will fetch solar system data via the internet which was initially posted to the cloud via your sunsynk dongle. It does not have any physical interfaces that are connected directly to your inverter. 
Please also note that this add-on only populates sensor values with data. It does not come with any cards to display information.

This add-on was debeloped for Sunsynk Region 2 customers only.
